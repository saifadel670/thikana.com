## **PROJECT INTRODUCTION**

#### **thikana.com** is a e-commerce and comunication webapplication for construction materials and consultancy..

## **IDEA & PURPOSE**

- In construction section, there is no such platform or ecommerce side where construction materials are sold. And also there is no platform for the engineers where they can get project directly.

- thikana.com is a platform which gives opportunities for engineers to get project directly from the client. The customer can personally meet with any engineer or select any posted design for him. If he needs any further information and support can request an engineer to guide him. As well as the customer will get a good price for construction material from this site and local sellers get informed who going to construct a building. They can offer him a good price. It creat a healthy market competition which creates scope to increase sell quantity for the seller and ensure a good reasonable price for customer.
